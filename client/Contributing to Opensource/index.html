        <div class="card">
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> Do you like to code?</h3>

            <h3>You dont have to contribute code</h3>
            <p>A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact,
                its often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. Youll do the project a
                huge favor by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!
                <br><br>
                Even if you like to write code, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a
                project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to
                work on other parts of the project.

            <li>Create art for t-shirts or a new logo,</li>

        <h2>Anatomy of an open source project</h2><br>
        <div class="card">
            <p>Every open source community is different.
                Spending years on one open source project means youve gotten to know one open source project. Move to a
                different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely
                different.
                That said, many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the
                different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.
            </p><br>
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i> A typical open source project has the following types of
                people:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Author:</b> The person/s or organization that created the project</li>
                <li><b>Owner:</b> The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not
                    always
                    the same as the original author)</li>
                <li><b>Maintainers:</b> Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the
                    organizational
                    aspects of the project (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)</li>
                <li><b>Contributors:</b> Everyone who has contributed something back to the project</li>
                <li><b>Community Members:</b> People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or
                    express
                    their opinion on the projects direction</li>
                <br>
                <p>Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as
                    tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a projects website for a
                    “team” page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.</p>
            </ul><br>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i> A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the
                top level of a repository.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>LICENSE</b>: By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the
                    project
                    does not have a license, it is not open source.</li>
                <li><b>README:</b> The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the
                    project. It
                    explains why the project is useful and how to get started.</li>
                <li><b>CONTRIBUTING</b>: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people
                    contribute
                    to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While
                    not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to
                    contribute to. A good example of an effective Contributing Guide would be the one from Codecademys
                    Docs repository.</li>
                <li><b>CODE_OF_CONDUCT:</b> The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants behavior associated
                    and
                    helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT
                    file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.</li>
                <li><b>Other documentation:</b> There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials,
                    walkthroughs, or
                    governance policies, especially on bigger projects like Astro Docs.</li><br>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> Finally, open source projects use the following tools to
                organize discussion:</h3>

            <li><b>Issue tracker:</b> Where people discuss issues related to the project.</li>
            <li><b>Pull requests:</b> Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress whether its to
                improve a
                contributors line of code, grammar usage, use of images, etc. Some projects, such as MDN Web Docs,
                use certain GitHub Action flows to automate and quicken their code reviews.</li>
            <li><b>Discussion forums or mailing lists:</b> Some projects may use these channels for conversational
                topics
                (for example, “How do I…“ or “What do you think about…“ instead of bug reports or feature requests).
                Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.</li>
            <li><b>Synchronous chat channel:</b> Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual
                conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.</li>

            </ul>

        <h2>How to submit a contribution</h2><br>
        <div class="card">
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-comments"></i> Communicating effectively</h3>
            <p>Whether youre a one-time contributor or trying to join a community, working with others is one of the
                most important skills youll develop in open source.
                Before you open an issue or pull request, or ask a question in chat, keep these points in mind to help
                your ideas come across effectively.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Give context. </b> Help others get quickly up to speed. If youre running into an error, explain
                    what youre trying to do and how to reproduce it. If youre suggesting a new idea, explain why you
                    think itd be useful to the project (not just to you!).</li>
                <li><b>Do your homework beforehand.</b>Its OK not to know things, but show that you tried. Before
                    asking for help, be sure to check a projects README, documentation, issues (open or closed),
                    mailing list, and search the internet for an answer. People will appreciate it when you demonstrate
                    that youre trying to learn.</li>
                <li><b>Keep requests short and direct.</b>Much like sending an email, every contribution, no matter how
                    simple or helpful, requires someone elses review. Many projects have more incoming requests
                    than people available to help. Be concise. You will increase the chance that someone will be
                    able to help you.
                <li>
                <li><b>Respect community decisions.</b>Your ideas may differ from the communitys priorities or vision.
                    They may offer feedback or decide not to pursue your idea. While you should discuss and look for
                    compromise, maintainers have to live with your decision longer than you will. If you disagree with
                    their direction, you can always work on your own fork or start your own project.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3><i class="fa-brands fa-readme" style="color: rgb(255, 179, 36);"></i> Gathering context</h3>
            <p>Before doing anything, do a quick check to make sure your idea hasn’t been discussed elsewhere. Skim the
                project’s README, issues (open and closed), mailing list, and Stack Overflow. You don’t have to spend
                hours going through everything, but a quick search for a few key terms goes a long way. <br><br>
                If you can’t find your idea elsewhere, you’re ready to make a move. If the project is on GitHub, you’ll
                likely communicate by doing the following:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Raising an Issue:</b> These are like starting a conversation or discussion</li>
                <li><b>Pull requests</b> are for starting work on a solution.</li>
                <li><b>Communication Channels:</b> If the project has a designated Discord, IRC, or Slack channel,
                    consider
                    starting a conversation or asking for clarification about your contribution.</li>

            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Opening an issue</h3>
            <p><b>You should usually open an issue in the following situations:</b></p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Report an error you can’t solve yourself</li>
                <li>Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies)</li>
                <li>Propose a new feature or other project idea</li><br>
                <b>Tips for communicating on issues:</b><br><br>
                <li>If you see an open issue that you want to tackle, comment on the issue to let people know you’re on
                    it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.</li>
                <li>If an issue was opened a while ago, it’s possible that it’s being addressed somewhere else, or has
                    already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.</li>
                <li>If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let
                    people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.

            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-code-fork"></i> <b>Fork the repository</b> and clone it locally. Connect your
                local to the original “upstream”
                repository by adding
                it as a remote. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you
                submit
                your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. (See more detailed instructions here.)</li>

            <li><b>Test your changes</b>! Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones
                when
                needed. It’s important to make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.</li>
            <li><b>Contribute in the style of the project</b> to the best of your abilities. This may mean using
                indents,
                semi-colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the
                maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.</li>

        <h2>What happens after you submit your contribution</h2><br>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>😭 You don’t get a response</h3>
            <p>Hopefully you checked the project for signs of activity before making a contribution. Even on an active
                project, however, it’s possible that your contribution won’t get a response.
                <br><br>
                If you haven’t gotten a response in over a week, it’s fair to politely respond in that same thread,
                asking someone for a review. If you know the name of the right person to review your contribution, you
                can @-mention them in that thread.
                <br><br>
                Don’t reach out to that person privately; remember that public communication is vital to open source
                projects.

                If you give a polite reminder and still do not receive a response, it’s possible that nobody will ever
                respond. It’s not a great feeling, but don’t let that discourage you! 😄 There are many possible reasons
                why you didn’t get a response, including personal circumstances that may be out of your control. Try to
                find another project or way to contribute. If anything, this is a good reason not to invest too much
                time in making a contribution before other community members are engaged and responsive.

            <h3>🚧 Someone requests changes to your contribution</h3>
            <p>It’s common that you’ll be asked to make changes to your contribution, whether that’s feedback on the
                scope of your idea, or changes to your code.
                <br><br>
                When someone requests changes, be responsive. They’ve taken the time to review your contribution.
                Opening a PR and walking away is bad form. If you don’t know how to make changes, research the problem,
                then ask for help if you need it. A good example of this would be the feedback that another contributor
                has given to @a-m-lamb on their pull request to Codecademy’s Docs.
                <br><br>
                If you don’t have time to work on the issue anymore due to reasons such as the conversation has been
                going on for months, and your circumstances have changed or you’re unable to find a solution, let the
                maintainer know so that they can open the issue for someone else, like @RitaDee did for an issue at
                OpenSauced’s app repository.

            <h3>👎 Your contribution doesn’t get accepted</h3>
            <p>Your contribution may or may not be accepted in the end. Hopefully you didn’t put too much work into it
                already. If you’re not sure why it wasn’t accepted, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask the maintainer for
                feedback and clarification. Ultimately, however, you’ll need to respect that this is their decision.
                Don’t argue or get hostile. You’re always welcome to fork and work on your own version if you disagree!
